### This is my first project using Ruby on Rails

Through this project, I am learning about the Ruby language, with a basic concept of CRUD, with data persisting in the database.

The app consists of a register of friends per user.
The current user only has access to the friends they have registered.
He can create, edit, delete and consult his friends

To use, follow the steps:

Open the terminal and join in friends-develop folder
   - cd friends-develop

After, run the following:
   - rails db:migrate

Then, start the server:
   - rails s

Access the page and sign up, creating a user.
